# HCOMP22 Papers from Kappa

Kappa is one of the research lines in the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group at Delft University of Technology. In Kappa, we investigate Crowd Computing and Human-Centered AI: two core areas which are instrumental in developing the next generation of data-driven AI systems.
Encompassing *Human-in-the-loop computing*, *Human-AI interaction*, and *User Modeling and Explainability*, these areas consider
- **AI by humans**: the computational role of humans for AI systems
- **AI for humans**: and the interactional role of humans with AI systems
